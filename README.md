# Random Data Structures and Algorithms Questions

Welcome to the repository containing a collection of random Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions along with their solutions or explanations. This resource is designed to help you practice and understand various DSA concepts through diverse problem sets.

## Objective
The main goal of this repository is to provide a curated list of DSA questions that cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:
- Arrays, Strings, and Matrices
- Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Trees, Graphs, and Heaps
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion and Backtracking
- And more...

## Usage
1. **Question Directory:**
    - Browse the directories to explore different categories or topics.
    - Each folder contains questions grouped by specific DSA topics.

2. **Question Files:**
    - Inside each folder, find individual question files (e.g., `.md`, `.txt`, or `.pdf`) with problem statements or descriptions.

3. **Solution or Explanation Files:**
    - Whenever available, corresponding solution files (e.g., `.java`, `.py`, or `.cpp`) provide implementations or detailed explanations for the questions.
